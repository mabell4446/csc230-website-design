          Tetris was created in 1984 by Alexey Pajitnov while he was working for
          the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
          Pajitnov was inspired by a puzzle game called "pentominoes," in which
          different wooden shapes made of five equal squares are assembled in a
          box. When he shared the game with his co-workers, they started playing
          it â€” and kept playing it and playing it. These early players copied
          and shared "Tetris" on floppy disks, and the game quickly spread
          across Moscow. Pajitnov sent a copy to a colleague in Hungary, it
          ended up on display in a software exhibit at the Hungarian Institute
          of Technology, where it came to the attention of Robert Stein, owner
          of Andromeda Software Ltd.
